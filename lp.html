            <h2>Naruto Uzumaki<h2>
        </div>
        <h3><p>Naruto Uzumaki is a shinobi of Konohagakure's Uzumaki clan. He became the jinchūriki of the Nine-Tails on the day of his birth — a fate that caused him to be shunned by most of Konoha throughout his childhood. Naruto is generally a very simple minded, easy going, cheerful person. He often rushes things, and misses obvious things such as Hinata's constant shyness around him. In the beginning of the series, Naruto is very fun loving, often pulling pranks on fellow villagers. This usually ends in a scolding from Iruka Umino. After joining Team Kakashi, Naruto worked hard to gain the village's acknowledgement all the while chasing his dream to become Hokage. In the following years, through many hardships and ordeals, he became a capable ninja, regarded as a hero both by the villagers, and soon after, the rest of the world, becoming known as the Hero of the Hidden Leaf. He soon proved to be one of the main factors in winning the Fourth Shinobi World War, leading him to achieve his dream and become the village's Seventh Hokage</p></h3>

            <h2>Sakura Haruno</h2>
        </div>
        <h3><p>Sakura Haruno is a kunoichi of Konohagakure. She had an ordinary childhood, raised by her parents without any serious tragedy or complications, unlike her team members. When she entered Konoha's Academy, a few of the girls in her class started picking on her because of her broad forehead. Personality is intelligent, courageous, and compassionate. Though her quick temper might make her easily irritated with others, Sakura has a kind heart underneath, caring for her friends above all. When assigned to Team 7, Sakura quickly finds herself ill-prepared for the duties of a shinobi. However, after training under the Sannin Tsunade, she overcomes this, and becomes recognised as one of the greatest medical-nin in the world.</p></h3>

            <h2>Kakashi Hatake</h2>
        </div>
        <h3><p>Kakashi Hatake is a shinobi of Konohagakure's Hatake clan. Famed as Kakashi of the Sharingan aka The Copy Ninja. He is one of Konoha's most talented ninja, regularly looked to for advice and leadership despite his personal dislike of responsibility. To his students on Team 7, Kakashi emphasises the importance of teamwork; he himself received this lesson, along with the Sharingan, from his childhood friend, Obito Uchiha. After the Fourth Shinobi World War, Kakashi becomes Konoha's Sixth Hokage. Kakashi has had a very rough life, losing countless of his loved ones such as his father. This rough upbringing has shaped him and his morals, explaining his famous quote "Those who don't follow the rules are scum, that's true. But those we abandon their friends are even worse than scum."</p></h3>

            <h2>Sasuke Uchiha</h2>
        </div> 
        <h3><p>Sasuke Uchiha is one of the last surviving members of Konohagakure's Uchiha clan. After his older brother, Itachi, slaughtered their clan, Sasuke made it his mission in life to avenge them by killing Itachi. He is added to Team 7 upon becoming a ninja and, through competition with his rival and best friend, Naruto Uzumaki, Sasuke starts developing his skills. Dissatisfied with his progress, he defects from Konoha so that he can acquire the strength needed to exact his revenge. His years of seeking vengeance and his actions that followed become increasingly demanding, irrational and isolates him from others, leading him to be branded as an international criminal. After learning the truth of his brother's sacrifice, later proving instrumental in ending the Fourth Shinobi World War, and being happily redeemed by Naruto, Sasuke decides to return to Konoha and dedicate his life to help protect the village and its inhabitants, becoming referred to as the "Supporting Kage"</p></h3>

            <h2>Master Jiraiya</h2>
        </div>
        <h3><p>Jiraiya was an exceptionally powerful shinobi, hailed as one of the greatest ninja of his generation and that Konoha ever produced. His true recognition came during the Second Shinobi World War when proved able to compete against Hanzō and his giant salamander Ibuse, and was dubbed a Sannin. Naruto has one of the most beloved cast of anime characters, and one of the strongest fan favorites is Jiraiya. Jiraiya is special because not only is he a legendary warrior, but he is the lovable uncle that Naruto never had but always deserved. He was basically his uncle/grandfather, after all.</p></h3>

        </div>
        <h3><p>Tsunade is a descendant of the Senju and Uzumaki Clan, and is one of Konohagakure's Sannin. She is famed as the world's strongest kunoichi and its greatest medical-nin. The repeated loss of her loved ones caused Tsunade to later abandon the life of a shinobi for many years. Tsunade possesses medical prowess and knowledge to such a high degree that she's capable of creating an antidote to virtually any poison in existence. Famed for her ability to nullify any poison during the Second Great Shinobi War, she can even treat the works of poison masters, like Chiyo from the Hidden Sand Village.</p></h3>

        </div> 
        <h3><p>Itachi Uchiha was a shinobi of Konohagakure's Uchiha clan who served as an Anbu Captain. He later became an international criminal after murdering his entire clan, sparing only his younger brother, Sasuke. He afterwards joined the international criminal organisation known as Akatsuki, whose activity brought him into frequent conflict with Konoha and its ninja — including Sasuke who sought to avenge their clan by killing Itachi. Following his death, Itachi's motives were revealed to be more complicated than they seemed and that his actions were only ever in the interest of his brother and village, making him remain a loyal shinobi of Konohagakure to the very end.</p></h3>
